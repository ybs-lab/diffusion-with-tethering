# Diffusion with tethering
This is the code for the paper [Hidden Markov modeling of single particle diffusion with stochastic tethering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01100).

See the notebook [`example.ipynb`](https://github.com/ybs-lab/diffusion-with-tethering/blob/main/example.ipynb) for an example of usage.

For more detailed information, see the docstring of the function `em_viterbi_optimization` in the module `em_algorithm.py`.
